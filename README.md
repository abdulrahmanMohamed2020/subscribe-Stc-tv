# subscribe Stc tv automation-test

## Project Overview:
* This automation framework utilizes Selenium and Java to automate test cases for [subscribe Stc tv]. It aims to provide comprehensive test coverage for the main features of the application. This README file serves as a guide for setting up and using the framework effectively.

## Features Covered:
* Validate the Subscription Packages â€“ Type & Price and Currency for all Countries (SA / Kuwait and Baharin)

## Getting Started

To use this automation framework, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 17 or higher)
- Docker installed and get a docker image for Docker Registry as we are using Remote WebDriver
- Allure Report Commands
- Make a container using this command line
     ```
       docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm [image name]:[version]
     ```

To set up the framework locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/abdulrahmanMohamed2020/subscribe-stc-tv.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `mvn install`

## Usage
To execute the test cases, use the following command:

1. Open the project using any IDE
    - in case you don't have an IDE you can open a command-line terminal on the project root path and type
      ```
       mvn clean test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=src/test/resources/testng.xml
      ```
2. Wait till all dependencies are resolved
3. Run the testing.xml file
4. After executing, you can easily generate the **Allure Report** by opening a command-line terminal on the project
   root path and type
```
allure serve "allure-result" path
```
